Within this repository you will find companion labs for the HashiCorp Certified Terraform Associate (003) Complete Video Course

The labs are designed to be followed when watching the corresponding videos. 

During this course I use a Debian Linux virtual machine for the labs. If you want to follow along with me more accurately, consider using that or your favorite Linux distribution. See [this link](https://prowse.tech/debian-11-linux-install/) for detailed step-by-step instructions (and video) on how to install Debian. 

Also, be sure to check out the companion practice exams here:

Enjoy!

> Notes: 
> - To run the labs in this course I use a Debian Linux Virtual Machine with Visual Studio Code installed. I recommend a minimum of 2 CPUs and 4 GB of RAM as well as 30 GB storage space. 
> - Consider removing the hidden .git directory if you don't want to have Git tracking enabled for the repository.
