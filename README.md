Within this repository you will find companion labs for the HashiCorp Certified Terraform Associate (003) Complete Video Course

The labs are designed to be followed when watching the corresponding videos. 

During this course I use a Debian Linux virtual machine for the labs. If you want to follow along with me more accurately, consider using that or your favorite Linux distro. See [this link](https://prowse.tech/debian-11-linux-install/) for detailed step-by-step instructions (and video) on how to install Debian. 

Enjoy!
